# PHPDOC for the PHP Solr Extension (PECL)

Compiled using the official PHP documentation. Doc and versioning improved.

Supported PECL Solr versions:
- 2.4.0 (Support Solr 4+)
- Specific directories for older versions are coming soon but all functions are already included in the current files 
(Use the versioning included in comments).

Happy coding! :)
